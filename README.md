# AI Answer Engine

This is a simple answer engine test project leveraging [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev) for educational purposes.

Pydantic AI agent answers questions using the search tool provided to it to search the web using [Tavily](https://tavily.com) and infer the answer by [Groq](https://groq.com) models.

1. Rename `.env.example` file to `.env` in the root directory and set the environment variables.

2. Run the FastAPI application:
    ```sh
    uvicorn app.api:main --reload
    ```
3. You can now access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/search`.
